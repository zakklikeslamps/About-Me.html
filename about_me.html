    <h2>Zakk Haug</h2>
    <p>I have gone by many names over the milennia. The Greeks referred to me as Zeus. The Babylonians 
        called me Marduk. The Egyptians, Ra. Today, on this mortal plane, I am known simply as Zakk, but 
        on the digital frontier, I am known as the great Lord Havok. I have been many things over the 
        centures; a conquerer, an artist, a minstrel, an athlete, a teacher, a carpenter, but now I find myself 
        returning to the role of student, in an effort to master a new skill. In the modern world I have
        made many enemies via the mediums known as "Destiny" on the Xbox & "Smash" on Nintendo, and they 
        have all met my wrath with a swift, brutal end. If you'd dare to challenge me as well, my handles 
        can be found online, as zakk likes lamp on XBOX, or simply request my Nintendo friend code. You 
        will fall before me. You can watch others suffer by my hand on my twitch stream here:
         <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/zakk_havok/">zakk_havok</a>. In an effort to harness my 
        sense of creatiity, I enjoy playin various musical instruments I've learned, including the saxophone,
        piano, guitar, as well as singing. I have also attempted to channel it, along with my desire to 
        create, into a hobby of working with LEGO; I have made some truly impressive creations, some of which
        can be viewed on my instagram account: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zakkhavokbuilds/">zakkhavokbuilds</a>. 
        Newly enganged to the most beautiful mortal woman concievable, this world will soon be ours, and I 
        shall rule once more, guiding all into a future where man can live the life he was meant.

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>Destiny/Destiny 2:</li>
        <p> I am a hunter, specializing in void & stasis powers. My armor was forged by 
            Saladin himself, and represents the strength & power of the New Iron Lords.
        </p>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>SSBU:</li>
        <p> I have trained in Smash for almost twenty years, but this iteration is, by-far, the most 
            finely tuned I have fought in. I am a Sonic main, but can also be found fighting as Kirby, Bowser,
            Pikachu or Zero-Suit-Samus. My hope/goal is to participate in officially sanctioned tournaments in the 
            near-future. 
        </p>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>Pokemon:</li>
        <p> I am and have always been an avid fan of the Pokemon franchise. I love playing the video games, 
            I was an active fan/follower of the anime as a kid, and I collecated (but did not actively play) the 
            cards. I am currently playing Shield version, and rather enjoying it. My favorite version/generation of 
            the franchise is easily the Heart Gold/Soul Silver versions on the original Nintendo DS. My favorite 
            Pokemon is Typhlosion. 
        </p>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>LEGO:</li>
        <p> As stated above, I am an avid LEGO builder to harness/fuel my sense of creativity. I currently
            have some Titans/Kaiju showcased at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Andysbrickshop">Andy's Brick Shop</a> 
            in the Oxford Valey Mall in Langhorne, PA. Feel free to stop by and check them out, or on my Instagram page 
            above. 
        </p>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>Music:</li>
        <p> Over the years I've learned to play many instruments, including the saxophone (alto & tenor), 
            piano, guitar, bass and vocals. During high-school I was a squad leader in marching band and a lead 
            soloist in jazz band, as well as earning second-chair tenor-sax player in the 2010 All-County band. 
            I have not performed in some time, but I am still proficient in all of these istruments. Some of my 
            favorite bands & artists include Blink 182, Wu-Tang Clan, Bad Religion, Cypress Hill, Less Than Jake, 
            Jay-Z, Linkin Park, Drake, MGK, Queen, and many others. 
        </p>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>Sports:</li>
        <p> I am a diehard Philadelphia Flyers fan; all the other teams in Philly I'll cheer for in a good
            season, but the Flyers are the only team I'd bleed for. I played ice/roller-hockey growing up as a left
            -forward, as well as being a rather active skateboarder (a video exists online somewhere of my friends 
            & I doing tricks/dumb things around Morrisville). I played intra-muralice-hockey while attending college 
            at Bloomsburg University; I continued to play as a forward, but also took up the position of back-up 
            goalie, as well as taking the record for "most fights in a single semester-season." Over the last few years 
            I've also found an interest in snowboarding, as it seems similar to skateboarding, but is actually quite 
            different. 
        </P>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>Film/TV:</li>
        <p> I'd consider myself a bit of a cinephile; I absolutely love watching a good movie or TV series. Some 
            of my favorite directors include Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Jungle Book, Mandalorian), The Russos 
            (Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, Community), Dan Harmon (Rick & Morty), Chuck 
            Lorre (Big Bang Theory, Two-And-A-Half Men), Tim Burton (Batman '89, Nightmare Before Christmas), Quentin 
            Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, Once Upon A Time in Los Angeles), the late Inoshiro Honda (the 
            Godzilla series: Showa Era), Michael Dougherty (X2: XMen United, Krampus, Godzilla: KOTM 2019), and The RZA 
            (The Man With The Iron Fists, Afro Samurai, Marvel's Iron Fist, Wu-Tang: An American Saga). My favorite film 
            is a tossup between Captain America: Civil War & Godzilla v Biollante. 
        </p>
        <li style='font-weight: bold;'>Other/Misc:</li>
        <p> I am an avid comic-book collector, mostly Marvel, Archie (Sonic the Hedgehog), IDW (Godzilla, TMNT) & Dark 
            Horse (Sonic the Hedgehog, Spawn) publications, but I am also extremely interested in anything 
            featuring the Joker, Batman, Red Hood, Deadpool or Spider-Man.
